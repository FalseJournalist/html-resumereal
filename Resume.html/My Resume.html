      <hr />
      <p>
        Hello all my name is Christian Nava, I am 26 years old an throwing my
        hat into software development. The reason behind a career switch was due
        to my realization of not wanting to become a lawyer nor go to law
        school.

<h2>Work Experiance:</h2>
<h4>Presidio (2015-Present)</h4>
    
<p>In regards to my work Experiance it isn't as robust or varied as others but as a resturant manager I've learned quite a few things</p>
    <ol>
    <li>People Managment is one of the hardest things ive had to learn and adjust over time, especailly during rush hours.</li><br>
    <li>Keeping things consant, resturant live and die by the ability to stay consistent both the front and back ends of the resturant.</li><br>
    <li>Always adapting and using teamwork to get through the day, one thing is for sure in the resturant game no day is the same! Unexpected issues with employees not showing up to the internet going out and even a never ending line waiting to be seated and served outside</li><br>
    <li>Working in the resturant/service industy has taught me invalue leesons about people and how they interact that will carry with me for the rest of my life! That I truly believe will carry over to any industry also about deadlines the resturant is all about deadlines and figuring out how the quickest and most efficient ways of completing problems but,
     also maintain the quailtiy of the restuant which why people come to our restuant in the first place. </li>
